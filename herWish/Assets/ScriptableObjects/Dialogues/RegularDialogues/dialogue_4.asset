    - 'I remember when I told my mother I was moving away with you near Mt. Faurek.
      Good lord, was that an event and a half. '
    - "I mean, it\u2019s - it\u2019s crazy how fast that woman could talk when she
      wanted to. I\u2019m talkin\u2019 road runnin\u2019, fast gunnin\u2019, blue-angels-jet-stunning
      speed here. "
