    - 'I always thought that I could never be the person I pretended to be. '
    - "Of course, I loved you. I loved your devotion towards climbing to the top.
      Your unrelenting passion. It\u2026inspired me to be better, to follow my own
      dreams.  "
    - "I pretended your dream was mine, that I supported it. But in truth\u2026I
      was always thinking of myself. Thinking of what I wanted. Dreams of mine that
      you helped come true."
    - "This\u2026this was never my dream. I still don\u2019t know if it is. I think
      that may have shown towards the end. I grew\u2026tired."
    - "I just wanted to spend our last remaining years, months, days\u2026together. "
    - "Now I\u2026now I wish I hadn\u2019t thought that way. Now I wish I hadn\u2019t
      pushed away. Now I see the importance of this dream, whether it\u2019s mine
      now or not. "
    - "Now I\u2026I just wish you were here."
