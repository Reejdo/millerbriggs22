    - Well, there it is. The bridge.
    - "Not too much more work, I just need to round up the wood I couldn\u2019t carry
      last time."
    - 'Of course, that wood is scattered all over the place. I even cut a little
      more than I needed to last time I took the journey. There should be some extra
      laying around. '
    - 'I think there''s even a pile all the way at the top that should be enough
      just on its own. '
    - "Navigating this strange terrain won\u2019t be easy -- well, it never is, but
      I\u2019m sure I can manage one last time. "
    - "Let\u2019s just hope the mountain doesn\u2019t give me a challenge I can\u2019t
      handle. "
