    sentences:
    - "You always told me to write more sappy stuff, so here\u2019s me, trying my
      best."
    - "Sorry that I\u2019m writing this too late. I wish I had done it sooner."
    - I remember it like it was yesterday. Spring. What a fine time to meet an even
      finer gal.
    - I, of course, was a younger man when I met you. It was outside a malt shop,
      you were there with a group of your friends, and I was loitering around with
      a group of mine.
    - 'My best friend at the time had just cut ties with his girl of five years,
      and we were there to cheer him up, or maybe find him a girl who could do that
      easier. I wasn''t looking for much myself. '
    - 'There were about nine of us and seven in your group, if I remember correctly.
      However, as if seeing the-the radiant beacon of a lighthouse springing forth
      from the sea, you caught my eye.  Your caramel hair shone like, like the moon
      among a hundred stars, just as bright and even more beautiful. '
    - 'Now, I don''t believe in love at first sight, honestly I think the notion
      itself is a little silly. Love is, is more like a flower, it takes time to
      blossom, and attraction is the seed. '
    - 'But I''ve got to say, if it were real, I most certainly had it. '
    - 'As we approached the other group, you turned towards us, laughing at something
      Susan or Mary had whispered in your ear. Your smile was so warm, so kind. '
    - "At that moment, I already knew -- I told myself, I had got to get that woman.
      Sometimes it\u2019s an instinct, and the moment I saw you, I knew that was
      it. You were my dream, my wish."
