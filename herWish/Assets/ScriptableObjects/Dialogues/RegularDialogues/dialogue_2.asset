    - "Ahem, anyways. Let\u2019s talk about something else, eh? "
    - I have always hated first dates.
    - "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I had a lot of fun on our first date. Though maybe
      roller skating wasn\u2019t the best choice, considering how bad you were at
      it. Yeah, I said it. You suuuuucked, hahaha. "
    - But even then, I was just so anxious the entire time.
    - "Isn\u2019t the point to get to know the other person? How in God\u2019s name
      was I supposed to do that when all I could do is question whether or not I
      smell bad, or if I look okay, or if I\u2019m talking too much. "
    - "Then you\u2019d hit a wall, and I\u2019d be worried about that, and it was
      just a stressful time. "
    - 'But, I guess you were probably a bit preoccupied yourself on that date too,
      with all the face-planting you were doing, hahaha. '
    - "So I suppose it wasn\u2019t all that bad. For me. "
