    sentences:
    - 'I wonder what I''ll find way up there, at the top. '
    - 'Your dad sure didn''t know, and neither did you. That was always the allure
      of reaching the peak, huh? '
    - Guess I'll have to find out for all of us. Maybe it'll be a lost city, or a
      pillar of gold. Or maybe...it'll just be rock.
    - Probably that last one, but I suppose it ain't about what's up there, really.
