    - I see now why you pushed me to do this, Cathlene.
    - "I\u2019ve always been so easy to give up. So easy to live comfortably. Had
      you not pushed me in this direction, I fear that I would have done exactly
      that my entire life. "
    - "I was on board when we started, but I\u2019m sure you saw me wavering over
      the years. Had this not been your dream, I would have never strived to complete
      this journey."
    - "It\u2019s never been about the mountain. I\u2019m so sorry I never saw that."
