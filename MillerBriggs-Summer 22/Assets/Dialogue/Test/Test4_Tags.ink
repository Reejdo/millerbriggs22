Hello there!

<sp:50>This text is going to be slower than the other one! <sp:100>This should be normal! 

<sp:100>100 is default! <sp:4>Do you understand?

<anim:wave>This should be shaking</anim> and this should not! 

There should be a long pause<p:long>...here!

Lastly, there should be some <anim:shake>shaky text</anim> to spice things up!

Does that all make sense to you?
